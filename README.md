#GitHashingExercise
Project Description:
Implement a shell script named hash_script that takes a 4-digit integer as input, hashes it using a standard algorithm (e.g., SHA-256), and saves the output in a file named hash_output.txt. The unique 4-digit integer is generated from the last four digits of the student ID (AEM).
