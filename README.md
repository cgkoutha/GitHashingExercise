This project is a simple exercise in creating a shell script (hash_script) that takes a 4-digit integer as input, hashes it using SHA-256, and saves the hash in a file (hash_output.txt). The project is version-controlled using Git, and both the script and the output file are committed to a local repository, which is then pushed to a public repository named GitHashingExercise on GitHub.
