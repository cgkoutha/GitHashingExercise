This project is a simple exercise in creating a shell script (hash_script) that takes a 4-digit integer as input, hashes it using SHA-256, and saves the hash in a file (hash_output.txt). The project is version-controlled using Git, and both the script and the output file are committed to a local repository, which is then pushed to a public repository named GitHashingExercise on GitHub.

Project Description:
Implement a shell script named hash_script that takes a 4-digit integer as input, hashes it using a standard algorithm (e.g., SHA-256), and saves the output in a file named hash_output.txt. The unique 4-digit integer is generated from the last four digits of the student ID (AEM).
